# DEFUNCT REPO
Brickimedia extensions and skins are now hosted on Gerrit. See the GitHub mirror: https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki-extensions-GlobalContribs

#GlobalContribs
GlobalContribs introduces two new special pages to MediaWiki, GlobalContributions and GlobalEditcount. Both behave exactly the same as their standard counterparts.

There is just one config variable, ```$gcwikis```, a list of DB names to look for contribs in.
